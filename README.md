Hi everyone I am a Palestinian computer engineer, lives in Gaza. I now work as Assessment Coordinator in UNRWA, which is UN special organization related to Palestinian refugees. Nowadays, I begin to review Java programming, which I learned before many years, and I want to be Android developer. 
Thanks
